>>>>>>>>>Why is the "unit test" question important?
-Because you won't always know what questions you'll be asked in an actual interviews.
-In modern times, jobs HIGHTLY value Criticial thinking, creating thinking, and logical thinking; and in this question they can get an idea of how you think.
-example questions: "how would you unit test this window?", "if you were shrunk down and put into a blendder how would you escape?", "how tall is the building we're interviewing in right now?"





>>>>>>>>>>>Why is "tell me about yourself" so important?
-So the interviewer can see what type of person you are, and get an idea of your verbal softskills.
-It's the FIRST question you'll be given, and there are NOT second "first impressions".
-It's more difficult for the interviewer to start with a negative impression of you AND for you to have to climb your way back into "good standing" in the interviewer's eye....than it would be for you to maintain "good standing" if you started with positive first impressions. Because in their case, the interviewer will be looking for confirmation bias.
-So normally you're pulled by the reins during the interview, the interviewER is asking all the question and guiding the topics of conversation. HOWEVER, with this question you're in FULL control of the conversation topics; which likely won't ever happen again. So NOW you have the opportunity to talk about topics that the interview didn't even realize that you had knowledge of. You could possibly change the ccourse of the entire interview that interviewer had planned.
-this question you will get VERY OFTEN


>>>>>>>>>>How are we supposed to answer "tell me about yourself" in our field?
-YOu should be speaking between 30 and 60 seconds.
	>IF you have a lot more you want to talk about after 60ish seconds, then ask them
	if they'd like to hear more. (You can bait them into more details by ending with 
	something like "I can go into more detail if you'd like?" or "would you like to
	hear more about that project?")
-Do NOT tell them about your hobbies and your personal life, that stuff will come later (because making yourself more human can be a good thing in the work place, especially when forming bonds with coworkers)
-FOR NOW, this is the time to tell the about your professional persona.
