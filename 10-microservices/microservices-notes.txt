What is a monolithic application?
-A large application; where all features are implemented in a single application.


Issues with monolithic applications?
-Scaling
	>what happens if we have an influx of traffic to only a single feature/service?
	>we'll need to create another server with ALL features/services, making each
		server unnecessarily heavy
-Single Point of Failture
	>what happens if a VERY infrequently used feature/service throws an exception?
	>well, the whole application comes tumbling down unnecessarily
-Singular Programming Language
	>What if DIFFERENT features/services in your application could be optimized using
	different programming languages?
	>You can only choose one language in a monolith


What is a microservice ecosystem?
-A Microservice ecosystem is an implmentation of a Service Oriented Architecture; where
	each service is an atomic feature belonging to the application.
-It's like a SOA on a smaller level.
