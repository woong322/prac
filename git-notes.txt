>>>>>What is a repository?
A repo is a place where you store "things".

>>>>>What is git?
Git is a version control system (VCS) and collaboration tool. In short, it's a tool that manages file history/versions (e.g. source code files). It keeps track of changes and provides tools to share content.

>>>>>>What is gitlab/github?
Github/Gitlab are online git hosting services. HOsting services can also supply additional tools that make collaboration for source code even easier; each host may have different services. Capitalism, amirite?


>>>>>>What is a distributed VCS vs a central VCS?

a CENTRAL VCS uses a central location online to store all source code, data, and records. There are some issues with this, however. What happens if you lose internet? or the website goes down? YOu don't have access to your data anymore.

A DISTRIBUTED VCS creates a COPY of the source code on each user's machine. That way, if you lose internet you can still work or see what the most recent changes you "pulled" are. Are you make change to you LOCAL version of the code base, then you "push" those change to an online host so that your team members may "pull" your changes.



git commands we've used in on day one:

git status			check the current state of git's files tracking
git config			is used to modify git's configurations
git clone			copies all files from a remote repository onto your local machine
git add .			adds files from your working directory into your staging directory
git add [filename1], [filename2], etc
git commit -m "my message"	creates a "new commit version" from your staging directory
git push			sends your LOCAL changes to the REMOTE repository
git pull			is git fetch + git merge
	git fetch		go to the remote git (gitlab) and retrieve any changes it has
					but will not merge them yet
	git merge		take one branch's content and merge it into the current branch
git checkout [branchname]	changes current branch to another branch
git checkout -b [branchname]	changes current branch IF it exists, if not create a new branch
					and change to it
git log				lists all commit versions
git revert			reverts an existing commit version
git stash			removes working directory changes (can be retrieved later)
git remote -v			lists your fetch and push URLs
git branch			is used for specific commands for a branch
