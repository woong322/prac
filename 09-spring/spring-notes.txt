>>>>>>>What is SPRING????
	>Spring is a module based, open source, java AOP framework.
	>It provides support for enterprise level applications; it provides infrastructure
	so you can focus on your application's business logic.
	(also, AOP is "Aspect Oriented Programming")


>>>What is a module?
	>A grouping of libraries that work together to achieve some goal using
	reusuable abstracted code.
	>In Spring, a module will take the form of a dependency (in our case, a maven
	dependency)
	>spring modules:
	   >>>core, beans, context, orm, aop, webmvc, security, test, etc
	>here is a diagram of spring's modules:

>>>HOW does Spring achieve its goals? Aka what features does spring have?
	>Inversion of Control (IoC)
	>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
	>Model View Controller Design Pattern (MVC)
	>a TON of astracted APIs


>>>What IS Inversion of Control (IoC)?
	>It is giving up control of some process to another entity.

>>What is the difference between IoC and DI?
	>DI is a SUBSET of IoC
	>Or to put it another way, DI is a specific TYPE of IoC
	>DI is SPECIFIC inverting control of your dependency's lifecycle
