///////////////////////
LET'S CONNECT TO OUR EC2 INSTANCE IN AWS
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html
///////////////////////

my public DNS:	ec2-52-14-14-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
my public ip:	52.14.14.207

(luckily for us, git bash is also an ssh client!!! So we're going to open a gitbash in the same directory as our pem file)

ssh -i [path to my pem file] ec2-user@[my public dns]
ssh -i ./trevasaurusrex.pem ec2-user@ec2-52-14-14-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

(to exit an ec2 just type "exit" into your terminal)


-----let's start by creating a simple directory
	mkdir git_repos
------let's install git on our ec2, so we can use the script that i've uploaded
	sudo yum install git -y
-----let's pull the training repo to this ec2
	git clone [url]
-----navigate to the script i've created for you then run that script
	sh [script-name]
	sh full-script.sh

------next, nagivate to our Pet-1 project (in the same folder as its pom.xml
	mvn clean package
----next, navigate into our target folder
-----run the jar file
	java -jar docker-springboot-demo.jar
-------can we run it detached?
	nohup java -jar docker-springboot-demo.jar &
-------let's talk about how to kill a detached process
	----first, let's find its pid
	sudo ps aux | grep 'jar'
	----next, kill it
	sudo kill -9 [pid]
