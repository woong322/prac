What is ReactJS?
>React is an opensourced javaScript Library. It was created and maintained by Facebook.
>React primarily  deals with Rendering (including DOM Manipulation) and EventHandling.
>React is also component based.

Just for our information, what is Angular?
>Angular is a frontend TypeScript based framework, maintained by Google.

Both React and Angular are component based. What the heck am I talking about when i say "component based"?

What is a component?
>A component is a fragment of HTML, CSS, and JS. These things create a small modularized section of the webpage; from there components can be used like building blocks to create a page view.


What is a SPA?
>Single Page Application
>this can be achieved in React and Angular by shuffling around components as opposed to going to an entirely new page.

What is JSX?
>JSX is a language that combines JS and XML syntax so it can transpile into valid JS.
>>>It can make your React DOM manipulation tynax FAR FAR FAR cleaner to look at.
>>>We'll use tools like "BabelJS" to transpile JSX into valid JS. While JSX can do XML, we'll be mainly using it for the HTML functionality.

What is Babel?
>Babel is a JS transpiler.
>Let's go over to "BabelJS.io" in the browser so we can lay with JSX and Babel itself for a moment.


-------ENOUGH TALKING!!! LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT REACT!!!!----------
THE FOLLOWING ARE TERMINAL COMMANDS

To install react on your machine (it also install the CLI aka Command Line Interface):
    "npm install -g create-react-app"  OR "npx create-react-app"
To create a react project:
    "create-react-app [custom-project-name]"
Now do an "ls" in the console to see that a project folder has been created for your custom-project-name
    "ls"
Nagivate to your custom-project-name folder:
    "cd [project-folder]"
To start the project:
    "npm start"
The stop react from running in your terminal:
    ctrl+c



When we start React, it the starting page has a URL to the official website (that contains a tutorial):
https://reactjs.org/

do NOT push your node_modules to gitlab...please....PLEASE......

BUT what happens if your coworker does a git pull without the dependencies?
>the project won't work
HOW do they get the dependencies then?
>they navigate to the project folder then do a "npm install"
>"npm install" will look at the current directory's "package.json" and download all those dependencies
