# Welcome to our gitlab repository

## Below are some resources that may help you along in the training

* The code examples we do in training are available to you in this repository

* There are markdown files in this gitlab. If you look inside the "00-additional-study-materials" folder then you'll see a few topic folders, in those topic folders you'll see markdown files (with the extension .md). If you click on these files from the broswer then you'll be able to view some nicely formatted notes.

* I'll also provide even MORE resources here: [Powerpoint files & Interview Prep Located here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PHo77l74cEZMV0tUWJsNMD7tznzDhKPj?usp=sharing)
