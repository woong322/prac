> no upfront cost or ongoign commitments
>the services are designed to work together
> services can be things like: compute, storage, database management, and network
>There are HUNDREDS of service, and the number changes each year
>Regions - Geographic locations where AWS is accessible. 16+
>Availability zones (AZ) - Data Centers. Minimum 2 per reion. 42+
>pay for what you use



Let's deviate from AWS for a moment to talk about TYPES of IT services that can be provide on the cloud
>IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
	>>example: virtual machines, processory, memory, harddrives, operating systems
	>> this is for system architechs
>PaaS - Platform as a service
	>>example: operating systems, data systems, web servers, etc
	>> this is for the devs
>Saas - Software as a service
	>>example: Microsoft 365, gSuite, dropbox, slack, Salesforce, etc
	>> this is for the end user

(bonus, Faas - Functions as a service)
(bonus, GaaS - Gaming as a service)




------NOW back to AWS------

AWS: RDS
>Relational Database Service
>types: Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc
>some of the services it provides: automated backup, database snapshots (user initiated),
	multiple AZ, automatic updates
>out of the box

AWS: EC2
>Elastic Compute Cloud
>virtual machine in the cloud
>benefits: scalable, Integrated with other AWS serives. Reliable. Secure. Inexpensive.
>It can use instance storage (part of this instance) or Elastic Block Stores (EBS) for storage
>It can use Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to be started in a certain configuration (specific OS, configs, etc)
>There are different sizes of EC2s, for exampple: t2.micro, t3.micro, t2.large, etc
>There are ways you can even specialize your memory, storage, processor, etc


AWS: AMI
>Amazon Machine Image
>Provides the information required to launch an instance (EC2)
>AWS offers many base AMI's for EC2 launching
>you can create yoru own AMI based on a snapshot of an EC2
>I like to think of an AMI like flashdrives or ps2 memory cards

AWS: EBS
>Elastic Block Stores
>virtual volumes (of storage) attached to one EC2 at a time
>can be copied as snapshots
>They can be: SSD, HDD, and magnetic

AWS: ELB
>Elastic Load Balancer
>virtual router
>balances the load of instances equally
	>>so like, if you have 1 instance at 90% capacity and another at 10% capacity,
		would this be an issue?
	>>ELB distributes the load evenly to each instance
>makes your infrastructure more resilient

AWS: autoscaling
>dynamically deploy or shutdown instances depending on a specific metric
	>>for example: when your instance's traffic exceeds 70% capacity AWS will automatically
		spin up a new EC2 and use your AMI to start the VM
	>>on the other end, you could make it so that if the traffic is lowr than 10% then you
		destroy the instance
>so now you don't need a human monitoring the servers 24 hours a day
>makes your infrastructure more resilient
>works well with ELB

AWS: Security Groups
>All instances in AWS need to be part of a Security Groups
>They provide transport layer security for your instances
>by default all network traffic is denied
>Security Group are a virtual white list
	>>you define which IPs and ports are allowed to access your instances
	>>you ALSO define whih of your ports are allowed to send information out.
>opening all ports neutralizes this security
>many of your instances can use the same security group

AWS: S3
>Simple Storage Service
>provides highly available and scalable cloud storage
>out of the box
>object based storage. Objecs are: plain files, images, videos, etc
>very cheap
>objecdts are stored in buckets
>dropbox uses S3 for its infrastructure


AWS: IAM
>Identity and Access Management
>this allows one to control access to a group of services within AWS
>can be used by companies to give employees access to resources

AWS: Lambda
>lambda are sections of code written to automate some functionality (basically a script)
>they can be triggered from a multitude of events
>no ec2 required
>pay per trigger

AWS: ROUTE 53
>Domain Naming Service
>can route traffic to different domains inside of your AWS
>basically, a virtual router

AWS: VPC
>virtual private cloud

AWS: Glacier
>cold storage, cost efficient and slow to access
>VERY cheap storage space, you can get a LOT of space for little cost


AWS: Snow Ball
>Amazing will mail you your data if you want it that bad

AWS: Snow Mobile
>Amazing will drive you your data
