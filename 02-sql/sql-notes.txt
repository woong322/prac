>>>>>What is a database (DB)?
>a place to store information
>a structured and organized set of data
>Databases (DB) support manipulation and storage of data etnries; DB make management of data significantly easier.

>>>>>>How is data structured in DBs?
>IN TABLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>A table represents a type of "entity" we want to store (not a specific record)
	>>things like: users, cars, pokemon, etc
>A table has rows and columns
	>>>columns	= attributes AKA fields AKA properties
	>>>rows		= data entries AKA records
>EACH record in that table has an OFFICIAL unique identifier refferred to as a "primary key"

>>>>>>>What is a DataBase Management System (DBMS)?
>The set of softwares which enable access to a database, allows manipulation of data, and reporting of data.
>It also processes queries
>There are a few types of DBMS:
	>>Relational	<-----WE'LL BE USING RELATIONAL
	>>Object Oriented
	>>Navigational
	>>etc



>>>>>>>>>>>What is SQL?
>Structured Query Language
>It's a syntax used to communicate with the database (DBMS)

Types of SQL languages:
-TransactSQL
-SQLServer
-SQLLite
-MySQL
-PostgreSQL
-Oracle SQL (aka PL/SQL)
-etc

>>>>>What....are the sublanguages of core SQL?
>DML-Data Manipulation Language
	>DML operates on records/data
	>These are CRUD methods: Create, Read, Update, Delete
	>keywords: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE

>DDL-Data Definition Language
	>DDL operates on the schema
	>The "schema" refers to the DB's structure (aka its containers, like tables, views, etc)
	>keywords: CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP
		     (c)    (u)              (d)
>DQL-Data Query Language
	>Some DBs consider Select as its own sublanguage
	>keywords: SELECT
	>example query:
		SELECT column1 FROM tableA WHERE attr1=value

>DCL-Data Control Language
	>DCL controls WHO HAS ACCESS to the data
	>keywords: GRANT, REVOKE

>TCL-Transaction Control Language
	>TCL deals with creating "transaction" and persisting data
	>keywords: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT


>>>>What is a transaction?
>it's a commit; a change to the state of the database (or group of changes)
>example:
	insert (2records), delete (4 records), update (1record), commit

	how many transactions have occured?
	>1 transaction has occurred

>but what is rollback and savepoint?
>>example:
	
	originalState|----changes--------commit-----changes2-----rollback

	>the answer is: the rollback will delete changes back to the most RECENT commit
	    >originalState|----changes--------commit
	

	originalState|----changes-----savepoint mysave----changes2-------rollback mysave


	originalState|----changes-----savepoint mysave----changes2---commit----rollback mysave
	>>this won't work


What are the properties of a transaction?
>The ACID properties
>Atomicity
	>>"all or nothing"; no partial transactions
>Consistency
	>>after a transaction the state of your schema is intact
	>>also, the database should LOGICALLY be consistent
>Isolation
	>>transactions cannot interfere with one another
>Durability
	>>changes you make to the state of the DB persist through issues/errors
