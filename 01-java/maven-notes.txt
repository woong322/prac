(common language independent data formats: XML and JSON)
--------------------------------
xml is a language independent data format
what this means is...that XML is used to transfer data between different programmming languages (or applications)

>>>>vocab
>an xml tag is a "keyword" surrounded by diamond brackets
	>>there are opening tags and closing tags
>an xml element is the opening tag and closing tag AS WELL AS all its contents
>you can use xml attributes to give metadata to elements


>>>>>>demo of xml
>>>>>(let's say we have an object1 with state [color weight] and 
>>>>>object2 with state [backgroundColor taste])

<xml>  		 <----(this is the root tag)

	<object1 attr1="attributesAreAWay" attr2="toGiveMetaDataToElements">
		<color>blue</color>
		<weight>144</weight>
	</object1>
	<object2>
		<backgroundColor>purple</backgroundColor>
		<taste>sweet</taste>
	</object2>

</xml>

(keep in mind, the xml structure is going to be sent from one application to another as a String.
the "parser" will read and interpret the string)

[Object1, Object2]
Object1=
	obj1.color=blue
	obj1.weight=144
