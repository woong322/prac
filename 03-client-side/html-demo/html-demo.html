<!--
    Remember XML? What was the purpose of XML?
    >>>XML is a platform indepedent data format used to transfer data from
    one entity to another. XML uses tags, elements, & attributes that can
    have parent child relationships in order to organize the data being
    sent.
    
    What is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?
    >>>HTML is VERY similar to XML. It uses tags, elements, and attributes as well
    to organize its functionality.
    
    The purpose of HTML is to display data to your client as well as transfer data. So it's
    almost like XML++; that is to say, it has more purpose. Your browser understands how
    to read HTML; when your browswer receives HTML from an HTTP request it will
    display that data for you. The data will look plain, but it WILL be there.

    What technology helps us make the data look pretty?
    >>>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Your HTML file will reference a CSS file that has
    instructions on how to make the data look PRETTY.

    What technology gives our HTML page functionality?
    >>>JavaScript (JS). Your HTML file will reference a JS file that will provide
    functionality.
