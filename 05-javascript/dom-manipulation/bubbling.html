    <!-- What is bubbling?
        >the process of events propagating to their parent elements to trigger
        even more functionality. So if a click event fires, that click even will be
        passed to all parents, grandparents, etc of the current element.

        What is capturing?
        >the process of events propagating from their parents to children; the opposite
        of bubbling
